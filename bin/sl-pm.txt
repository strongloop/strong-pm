usage: %MAIN% [options]

The Strongloop process manager.

Options:
  -h,--help         Print this message and exit.
  -v,--version      Print version and exit.
  -b,--base BASE    Base directory to work in (default `.strong-pm`).
  -l,--listen PORT  Listen on PORT for git pushes (default 8701).
  -C,--control CTL  Listen for local control messages on CTL (default `pmctl`).
  --no-control      Do not listen for local control messages.

The base directory is used to save deployed applications, for working
directories, and for any other files the process manager needs to create.

The process manager will be controllable via HTTP on the port specified. That
port is also used for deployment with strong-deploy. Basic authentication
can be enabled for HTTP by setting the STRONGLOOP_PM_HTTP_AUTH environment
variable to <user>:<pass> (eg. strong-pm:super-secret). This is the same format
as used by the --http-auth option of pm-install.

It is also controllable using local domain sockets, which look like file paths,
and the listen path can be changed or disabled. These sockets do not support
HTTP authentication.
