usage: %MAIN% [options] [command ...]

Run-time control of the Strongloop process manager.

Options:
  -h,--help               Print help and exit.
  -v,--version            Print version and exit.
  -C,--control CTL        Control endpoint for process manager.

The control endpoint for the process manager is searched for if not specified,
in this order:

1. `STRONGLOOP_PM` in environment: may be a local domain path, or an HTTP URL.
2. `./pmctl`: a process manager running in the current working directory.
3. `~/.strong-pm/pmctl`: a process manager running in the user's home directory.
4. `/var/lib/strong-pm/pmctl`: a process manager installed by pm-install.
5. `http://localhost:8701`: a process manager running on localhost

An HTTP URL is mandatory for remote process managers, but can also be used on
localhost. If the process manager is using HTTP authentication
then valid credentials must be set in the URL directly, such as
`http://user-here:pass-here@example.com:7654`.

When using an HTTP URL, it can optionally be tunneled over ssh by changing the
protocol to `http+ssh://`. The ssh username will default to your current user
and authentication defaults to using your current ssh-agent. The username can be
overridden by setting an `SSH_USER` environment variable. The authentication can
be overridden to use an existing private key instead of an agent by setting the
`SSH_KEY` environment variable to the path of the private key to be used.

Commands:
  status                  Report status, the default command.
  shutdown                Stop the process manager.
  start                   Start the current application.
  stop                    Hard stop the current application.
  soft-stop               Soft stop the current application.
  restart                 Hard stop and restart the current application with
                            new config.
  soft-restart            Soft stop and restart the current application with
                            new config.
        "Soft" stops notify workers they are being disconnected, and give them
        a grace period for any existing connections to finish. "Hard" stops
        kill the supervisor and its workers with `SIGTERM`.

  cluster-restart         Restart the current application cluster workers.
        This is a zero-downtime restart, the workers are soft restarted
        one-by-one, so that some workers will always be available to service
        requests.

  set-size N              Set cluster size to N workers.
        The default cluster size is the number of CPU cores.

  objects-start ID        Start tracking objects on worker ID.
  objects-stop ID         Stop tracking objects on worker ID.
        Object tracking is published as metrics, and requires configuration so
        that the `--metrics=URL` option is passed to the runner.

  cpu-start ID [TIMEOUT]  Start CPU profiling on worker ID.
        TIMEOUT is the optional watchdog timeout, in milliseconds.  In watchdog
        mode, the profiler is suspended until an event loop stall is detected;
        i.e. when a script is running for too long.  Only supported on Linux.

  cpu-stop ID [NAME]      Stop CPU profiling on worker ID.
        The profile is saved as `<NAME>.cpuprofile`. CPU profiles must be
        loaded into Chrome Dev Tools. The NAME is optional, and defaults to
        `node.<PID>`.

  heap-snapshot ID [NAME] Save heap snapshot for worker ID.
        The snapshot is saved as `<NAME>.heapsnapshot`.  Heap snapshots must be
        loaded into Chrome Dev Tools. The NAME is optional, and defaults to
        `node.<PID>`.

  ls [DEPTH]              List dependencies of the current application.

  env[-get] [KEYS...]     List specified environment variables. If none are
                          specified, list all variables.
  env-set K=V...          Set one or more environment variables.
  env-unset KEYS...       Unset one or more environment variables.
        The environment variables are applied to the current application, and
        the application is hard restarted with the new environment after change
        (either set or unset).

  log-dump [--follow]     Empty the log buffer, dumping the contents to stdout.
                          If --follow is given the log buffer is continuously
                          dumped to stdout.

Worker `ID` is either a node cluster worker ID, or an operating system process
ID. The special worker ID `0` can be used to identify the master.
