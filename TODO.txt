deploy: url is not valid when the port is closed from strong-deploy, bad

deploy: host required for url when its git, but not for pack, bad

pm: protocol, remove current, put sub in command, but if target is present,
 assume it goes to supervisor... will make things nicer

deploy: need to give a weird URL... we should be able to construct that

BUG: npm-ls seems to cause .size to be reset on instance update
